# osTicket Incident Handling

In this lab, I simulate the lifecycle of support tickets within the osTicket system by creating, managing, and resolving tickets as both end users and help desk agents. The objective is to practice efficient ticket handling, ensure proper classification, and understand escalation paths while maintaining clear communication with the user.

# Technology Utilized
- osTicket v1.15.8
- Windows 10 Virtual Machine (Azure)
- RDP for VM access
- IIS, PHP, MySQL for backend support
